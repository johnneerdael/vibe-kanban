## Themes

Switch between light and dark themes to suit your preference.

## Default Agent Configuration

Choose the default agent and variant for new task attempts. This profile is pre-selected when creating new task attempts and follow-ups.

1. **Select an agent** (e.g., Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex)
2. **Choose a variant** if available (e.g., Default, Plan, Router)

<Tip>
You can override the default agent configuration per attempt in the create attempt dialog.
</Tip>

## Editor Integration

Configure integration with your preferred code editor for a seamless development workflow.

### Selecting Your Editor

Choose from various supported editors:
- **VS Code** - Microsoft's popular code editor
- **Cursor** - VSCode fork with AI-native features
- **Windsurf** - VSCode fork optimized for collaborative development
- **Neovim**, **Emacs**, **Sublime Text** - Other popular editors
- **Custom** - Use a custom shell command

### Remote SSH Configuration

</Frame>

Since Vibe Kanban runs inside a Docker container, your code files are located within the container's `/repos` volume. To open these files in your local IDE, you should configure **Remote SSH**.

#### When to Use Remote SSH

Enable remote SSH configuration when:
- Vibe Kanban runs in Docker (local or remote)
- You access the web UI through a tunnel or reverse proxy
- You want your local editor to connect to the Docker host via SSH

#### Configuration Fields

1. **Remote SSH Host** (Optional)
   - The hostname or IP address of your Docker host
   - Examples: `localhost`, `192.168.1.100`, `my-server`
   - Must be accessible via SSH from your local machine

2. **Remote SSH User** (Optional)
   - The SSH username for connecting to the Docker host

#### How It Works

When remote SSH is configured, clicking "Open in VSCode" (or Cursor/Windsurf):
1. Generates a special protocol URL like: `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path/to/project`
2. Opens in your default browser, which launches your local editor
3. Your editor connects to the host via SSH
4. The project or task worktree opens in the remote context

<Note>
Ensure the path on the host matches the path mapped to `/repos` in your `docker-compose.yml`.
</Note>

## Git Configuration

Configure git branch naming preferences.

### Branch Prefix

Set a prefix for auto-generated branch names (e.g., `vk` results in `vk/task-name`). Leave empty for no prefix.

## Notifications

Toggle sound effects and push notifications to stay informed about task status changes.

## Telemetry

Enable or disable telemetry data collection to help improve Vibe Kanban.

## Task Tags

Manage global task tags to accelerate task creation across all projects. Task tags allow you to define reusable text snippets that can be inserted into task descriptions using @mentions.

## Agent Settings (Profiles & Variants)

Define and customise agent variants under **Settings → Agents**. Variants let you maintain multiple configurations for the same agent.

Vibe Kanban integrates with GitHub to let you create pull requests directly from your task attempts. This integration relies on the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) which is pre-installed in the official Docker image.

## Setup

Since the GitHub CLI is already included in the Docker image, you only need to authenticate it.

### Authentication

To authenticate the GitHub CLI inside your running container, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec vibe-kanban gh auth login
```

1.  Select **GitHub.com**.
2.  Choose **HTTPS** or **SSH** as your preferred protocol.
3.  Select **Login with a web browser**.
4.  Copy the one-time code provided and paste it into the GitHub activation page.

<Check>
Your authentication is stored in the `/data` volume, so it will persist even if you restart or update the container.
</Check>

## Creating a Pull Request

Once authenticated, you can create pull requests directly from a task:

1.  Open a task that has changes you want to merge.
2.  Click the **Create PR** button.
3.  A dialog will appear pre-filled with:
    *   **Title**: Derived from the task title.
    *   **Description**: Derived from the task description.
    *   **Base Branch**: The target branch for your changes.
4.  Click **Create** to open the PR on GitHub.

If the operation is successful, the task status will update, and a link to the new Pull Request will be available in the UI.
